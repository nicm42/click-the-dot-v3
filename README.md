## General info

This game existed before, in jQuery. I wanted to learn Svelte, so starting with something where I already had an idea of what to do seemed like a good idea. To the original game, that had three shapes, I added three more, and also some high scores based on the number of attempts.

## Features

A game where the shape grows on click and you have to click on it again when you think it's twice the size.

## Setup

To view this project visit the [demo](TBC) or download the files, open a terminal in that folder and install locally using npm:

```
npm install
```

Go to [MongDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), sign up for an account and set up a database.

Add your database connection into .env.example where it says 'XXX' and rename the file to .env

Run the server and the app locally:

```
npm run dev
npm run server
```
